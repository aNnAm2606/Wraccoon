# Wraccoon
 A small game about a raccoon.
One day a girl brings a big, fat cat home. Turns out this is not just a simple cat, but a wild raccoon. But it's so warm and safe at home, there's always foo and a place to take a nap in peace if we don't count other pets stealing the attention, this can be considered heaven!!! The objective is clear - Get rid of all the other pets or go back to the cruel world!
